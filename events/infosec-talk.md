## About Event

It was our immense pleasure to hear that the participants asked us to encourage more sessions like this. A Certificate Of Participation was provided to those who attended the session. The event was well organized and systematic, attending the queries of the participants was the first priority.

The valuable talks of our former President Mr. Manik Garg were loved and appreciated by all. People were eager to attend more such sessions from him and were highly satisfied with the knowledge delivered by him. In all, it was a great success and we look forward to add more stars to our Microsoft Technical Community
