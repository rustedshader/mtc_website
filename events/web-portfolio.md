## About Event

A 10-days assignment or project of making a portfolio website was also assigned to students and a certificate of completion was provided to those who successfully built the website. During the 10 days given to participants for completion of the project Madhav Manocha had the responsibility of solving all queries regarding project.

We were glad to hear that the students asked us to conduct more workshops like this. This had been an awesome open-door platform given by MTC to all the enthusiasts. As through this occasion, they were given extraordinary opportunities to enhance upon their abilities and have an aggressive coding and open source knowledge.
